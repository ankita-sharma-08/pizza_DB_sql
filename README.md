# Pizza_DB Mini Project
This is a mini project based on the Pizza_DB database.

# Pizza Sales SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores sales and performance metrics of a fictional pizza store using a MySQL database. The dataset includes details on orders, pizza types, sizes, categories, prices, and quantities. The goal is to answer a series of business questions using SQL â€” ranging from basic aggregations to advanced analytics.
